# Content Directory

This directory holds all of the content for the site. All routes here are mapped to the webpage routes generated.

This is managed using Front Matter CMS in VS Code. I'm really liking this concept of a local CMS controlled by git, and it's really convenient to write in Markdown.

Future improvement may be a refactor to use .mdx files for even better flexability. However, this works for now.
