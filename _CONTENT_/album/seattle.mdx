I spent over **five weeks** couch-surfing the West Coast, and riding the **Amtrak Coast Starlight** from [Los Angeles](/album/los-angeles) to [San Francisco](/album/san-francisco), and the **Amtrak Cascades** from [Seattle](/album/seattle) to [Vancouver](/album/vancouver) in early 2023. Trains are so cool man!
