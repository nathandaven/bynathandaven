In 2022, during my last semester at **Georgia Tech** I was lucky enough to visit my girlfriend for several weeks, who studied abroad at **ITU Copenhagen**. Visited [Copenhagen](/album/copenhagen), [Berlin](/album/berlin), [Hamburg](/album/hamburg), [Prague](/album/copenhagen), and Malm√∂, and was really fun being public transit-pilled here!
