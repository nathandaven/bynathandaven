In 2022, during my last semester at **Georgia Tech** I was lucky enough to visit my girlfriend for several weeks, who studied abroad at **ITU Copenhagen**. Visited [Copenhagen](/album/copenhagen), [Berlin](/album/berlin), [Hamburg](/album/hamburg), [Prague](/album/copenhagen), and Malm√∂, and was really fun being public transit-pilled here!

My second time in Hamburg! I'm here for a wedding in Reinbek (suburb of Hamburg), didn't get much time in Hamburg proper but went on a solo quest. Also included some wedding snaps from my Ricoh in here.
