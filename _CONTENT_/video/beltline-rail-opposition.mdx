**Atlanta is at a crossroads.**

For the past twenty years, we have been building the epic undertaking we all know as the Beltline – a vision for 33 miles of paved trail and 22 miles of light rail transportation, aligned directly with dense market housing, affordable housing, and mixed uses.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/02.jpg)

However, while the Beltline has been marketed as this – a project bringing both rail transit _and_ last mile connections via the trail, the public hasn't seen a morsel of transit along the entirety of the Atlanta Beltline. Really, most people see it as a vehicle for gentrification and displacement.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/01.jpg)

Luckily, this was all about to change next year, as MARTA was to expand the Atlanta Streetcar and create the first Beltline Rail route, connecting Downtown to destinations locals and visitors alike love: Krog Street, Inman Park, and Ponce City Market. Its the single most successful public rail transit route MARTA could build right now.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/03.jpg)

Unfortunately, there's a battle we're seeing in the public eye, between the public vision of the Beltline as a transit oriented project, and the vision of a few select powerful NIMBYs and a lobbyist who fear change to their beloved trail. And now they have the ear of our _beloved_ mayor, Andre Dickens.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/10.jpg)

He's pushing an alternative, hypocritical plan that will ultimately kick the transit bucket down the road for another decade, and in this video, I hope to do something they won't tell you: double down on the Eastside Extension, and convince y'all it's time to make some noise about this.

**Alright, lets dive in.**

## Background

The year is 1999. We're reeling off the high of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Outkast, Ludacris, and Jermaine Dupri are blasting in your stereo, and you have the first Atlanta Thrashers game this weekend. But quietly, one of the most infamous projects in Atlanta today was being formulated.

Around this time, rail to trail projects were becoming popular in urban design discussion, especially in urban contexts. The New York City Highline is the most infamous version of this, alongside concepts such as the Charlotte Rail Trail, Miami Underline, and others. Atlanta's version the Atlanta Beltline, was one of the first and most ambitious proposals though.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/12.jpg)

Described in Georgia Tech PHD student Ryan Gravel's graduate thesis, "_[Belt line - Atlanta : design of infrastructure as a reflection of public policy](https://repository.gatech.edu/entities/publication/c4c02e00-9638-4381-a8d2-c9bc8991d7a5),_" he envisioned an urban development project circulating Atlanta. The idea: connect over forty in-town Atlanta neighborhoods with walking, biking, and light rail public transportation infrastructure.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/15.jpg)

What made the Beltline different (in origins) from similar projects like the NYC High Line, was its focus on transportation via a light rail line, and dense urban infill with both affordable and market housing, rather than being a private park and investment vehicle.

Since Mayor Shirley Franklin's creation of Atlanta Beltline Inc. in 2005, they have nearly completed the highly sought after "U" shaped "Emerald Necklace," and have completed most property acquisition and made preliminary studies for rail transit. According to Beltline [leadership](https://roughdraftatlanta.com/2025/06/18/beltline-2026-budget-approved/), the [17.9 mile continuous trail from the Westside to the Eastside will be done by next year](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/majority-of-beltline-to-be-completed-by-world-cup/4FSZHAA7YFB2VH6SZX5PO7SBLI/)!

#### Transit Component

Now, the only thing that was not funded was the actual transit. So in 2016, Atlanta voters passed More MARTA, a bill that included funding for the first portion of Beltline Rail using a half penny sales tax, an extension of the Downtown loop to the Eastside Beltline, up to Ponce City Market, alongside many other transit projects.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/03.jpg)

The reason this route was chosen is because its the densest and most viable corridor in the entire city for new rail transit. The key to effective rail transit is **aligning dense housing and employment with public transit lines.** And in a city like Atlanta, one of the lowest density cities in the United States, the Atlanta Beltline provides a unique opportunity to double down.

So over the past several decades, the City of Atlanta (for better or worse) has been incentivize intense development along the Eastside Beltline corridor, with the goal of connecting it with light rail. They've done this often times by offering intense tax breaks to development, delaying property taxes to incentivize development.

It's brought [millions of dollars in private investment](https://beltline.org/learn/progress-planning/research-reports/funding/), and has transformed the corridor into one of the best corridors for linear transportation. Specifically, along the Eastside Beltline, the population densities are now over [10,000 people per square mile](https://youtube.com/watch?v=sUzZB3fngXk&t=251), making it the sole most obvious corridor for light rail, especially considering the right of way has already been set aside next to the trail for the light rail.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/18-1.jpg)

#### Detailing the Streetcar Plan

However, there is actually a lot more context to rail on the Beltline than just the Beltline. To understand, we have to zoom out–the Eastside Extension project actually is a step in achieving a larger long term Streetcar plan for Atlanta.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/19.jpg)

All of this is part of a multi-decade long plan known as the Streetcar Plan. It's a plan that crisscrosses the city with different rapid routes–the most ambitious plan detail numerous routes, including the Beltline Rail Loop. The first effort for this vision was the Atlanta Streetcar Downtown Loop, a project that created the 2.2 mile streetcar we see in Downtown today back in 2008.

While many [criticize](https://thetransitguy.substack.com/p/a-streetcar-not-desired-why-obama) the problems with the Downtown Streetcar, such the mixed traffic alignment letting it get stuck in traffic, its low ridership, and a route that "doesn't go anywhere," we have to realize that this was meant as a first step to the system.

That's why the designers of the Downtown Loop specifically chose Siemens S70 hybrid rail vehicles, for use in separated Beltline Rail segments. Additionally, the Downtown Loop also built the [maintenance facility](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BoEpkktPZKAicNGK9) and infrastructure for light Rail in Atlanta, [underneath the connector in Sweet Auburn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BoEpkktPZKAicNGK9).

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/06.jpg)

These are just two reasons why the [Eastside Extension](https://vimeo.com/740426533/6aef507132) was chosen as the next expansion. Ponce City Market and the Eastside Beltline are massive trip generators, and there's really no other destination in the city that could be as successful for light rail. **I'll reiterate: the Eastside Beltline is the single best corridor for fixed guideway rail transit in the _entire city._**

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/22-1.jpg)

## The Opposition

Unfortunately, the biggest problem with building the path and development _before_ the transit is that now it is potentially disruptive to build along the trail.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/23.jpg)

That's one of the arguments of [Better Atlanta Transit](https://betteratlantatransit.org/), an organization formed to specifically fight the Eastside Extension, [formed of business owners](https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2023/10/19/beltline-rail-eastside-trail-supporters), [a website owned by Portman Holdings](https://bsky.app/profile/alexip718.com/post/3lkbo7xlva22c), and a [lobbyist](https://lexiconstrategies.com/linville). Last year they started an artificial grassroots campaign, also known as an astroturfing campaign, to try to create distrust in the Beltline Project.

<Video src="UbfWzszPwAg" startTime={15} />

You've probably seen these signs along the Beltline that read "Save the Beltline!" with taglines against the streetcar.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/08.jpg)

[When you look into their platform, some talking points include:](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64cbd9b5ec937b74d5c2667b/t/677c1410f38051103151928a/1736184859808/Mobilize+the+Beltline+with+Sources+250105.pdf)

- That the project is expensive and disruptive.
- The Beltline is a public park and not a transportation corridor.
- They claim light rail is an outdated technology when we have self driving pods and escooters, and that safety is a huge concern.
- And that there are "better projects" for transit-dependent riders, such as Infill Stations or BRT projects.

#### Debunking

Ultimately, the talking points of Better Atlanta Transit can be easily debunked:

- For one, the Eastside Extension is a fantastic value as it has the [highest ridership potential](<https://itsmarta.com/uploadedFiles/MARTA_101/Why_MARTA/Moremarta/More%20MARTA%20Atlanta%20Technical%20Summary%20(appendices%20included).pdf>) out of any corridor in Atlanta.
  ![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/22-1.jpg)
- The Eastside Beltline is clearly a transportation corridor considering there is no seating space along the Beltline, and people are always traversing the Beltline between various trip generators.
- Light Rail is a serious, not vaporware technology used in cities around the globe, and statistically is extremely safe as a mode of transport. Additionally, cited alternatives like building a second lane for micro mobility and self-driving pods would cause a similar amount of disruption as rail construction.
- And lastly, scapegoating other transit projects is a bad way of saying that public transport should continue to be segregated between lower and higher income populations. The Eastside Beltline would do absolutely amazing PR for public transit in Atlanta, and bring more investment and priority as a whole.

#### The Scoop

Now you might say, there could be some plausible deniability and this organization is simply just some "concerned locals." However, after being tipped to some interesting [public donation records](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/823296216/202520459349200627/IRS990EZ), theres something deeper going on here. For example:

- A major donor to Better Atlanta Transit is a group known as the [1859 Fund](https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessId=2418893&businessType=Domestic%20Nonprofit%20Corporation&fromSearch=True), per this [Form 990](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/823296216/202520459349200627/IRS990EZ). This document references Jack Murphy of Carter Real Estate Holdings as CEO of the 1859 Fund. Carter is a large holder of Atlanta properties, including [Atlantic Station, Summerhill, The MET, and numerous other mixed-use projects.](https://www.carterusa.com/mixeduse)
- Looking at the [original filing for the 1859 Fund](https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch/DownloadFile?filingNo=14950977) via [Georgia's business database](https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessId=2418893&businessType=Domestic%20Nonprofit%20Corporation&fromSearch=True), we can see it was created by Jason Boles. He is behind [Tabularius Group, a prominent dark-money right wing political donation engine](https://ncnewsline.com/2020/09/18/pw-special-report-trump-linked-effort-to-infiltrate-progressive-nc-groups-prompts-investigation/) that has successfully propelled campaigns such as [Marjorie Taylor Green and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court](https://kumu.io/LisaSorg/jason-boles#map-4pPcUKZE).

I bring this up to point out that Better Atlanta Transit isn't just some local, concerned residents–its just a small tendril of a vast network of corporate interests, and even right wing dark money PAC's.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/27.jpg)

#### Nashville Comparison

Silly right? Well, lets look at another city, Nashville, Tennessee, which went through a similar battle with similar dark money donors. [In 2018, Nashville was trying to pass a public transport referendum that would fund light rail, BRT, and bus improvements, a transformative proposal for Nashville citywide.](https://transitcenter.org/publication/derailed/)

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/28.jpg)

In doing so, [several anti-transit groups cropped up](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2018/04/26/koch-brothers-and-dark-money-gang-up-on-nashville-transit-referendum) with similar goals to Better Atlanta Transit, such as an infamous Koch Brothers climate denial project "Americans for Prosperity", "NoTax4Tracks," and "Better Transit for Nashville." Sound familiar?

[NoTax4Tracks specifically raised $950,000](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2018/04/26/koch-brothers-and-dark-money-gang-up-on-nashville-transit-referendum), [most of which from private donors](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/04/11/bulk-money-raised-opposition-nashville-transit-group-kept-secret/506717002/), and Americans for Prosperity is funded by the [Koch Brothers, two oil billionaires fueling fights against transit across the country.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/climate/koch-brothers-public-transit.html) And guess what? The vote did not pass.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/29.jpg)

As you can see, its common for these groups to use tactics that try to establish credibility for being pro-transit, but in reality, the goals are simply to kill a project with no following through. **The goal is always to simply make the public scared or confused enough to not support the project.**

## Enter the Mayor

All of this is why its such a shame that the [formerly pro Eastside Rail](https://beltlinerailnow.com/news/2021/11/21/tale-of-two-mayoral-candidates) mayor, Andre Dickens, has come forward with a new plan for Atlanta that bows to the wills of these NIMBY's and [parrots the exact same talking points](https://x.com/philip_atlanta/status/1780309190914822454?mx=1).

<Video src="mRPlm4x_Xkg" startTime={70} />

The point I want to make is, **it's all the exact same exact talking points as Better Atlanta Transit presents**, just with a fresh coat of paint!

- The Mayor cites that we should look at infill stations and other projects such as North Ave BRT through an [executive order](https://www.atlantaga.gov/Home/Components/News/News/15040/).
  ![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/32.jpg)
- The Mayor cites transit _to_ the Beltline instead of _on_ the Beltline, but then pushes for Southside rail on the Beltline.
  ![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/30.jpg)
- And even worse, he seems to support the notion of alternatives to rail such as self driving pods and separated lanes in the interim on the Eastside Trail.

Basically, the plan he presents is the same as More MARTA 2016, just with a few twists. For one, the Beltline Rail will be split into "two phases," one being the Eastside Extension ending _at_ the Beltline, instead of reaching the major trip generator of Ponce City Market. And then a second phase, that will construct 4+ miles of separated Beltline Rail on the Southside, with a whole new maintenance facility, and _also_ extend the Eastside Extension project to Ponce City Market.

**What's worse?** The collusion is _so_ obvious, that the most recent version of the Better Atlanta Transit platform document has a _[brand new paragraph](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/64cbd9b5ec937b74d5c2667b/t/679256b3aa57c606515bdec8/1737643699625/25+01+22+Integrated+Mobility+Strategy.pdf)_ celebrating the Mayor's decisions!

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/paragraph.png)

The reality is, the Mayor is using the guise of equity as a distraction to bend to the wills of Better Atlanta Transit's wishes. There's actually going to be zero follow through on this plan, especially considering that this announcement is _days_ after [announcing his re-election campaign](https://www.wabe.org/atlanta-mayor-andre-dickens-makes-the-case-for-reelection/) (which he is currently running unopposed so far).

<Video src="3TxlOobqDf0" startTime={1281} />

Would Southside rail be great? Or infill stations? Of course! However, what the public is upset about, is losing the obvious slam dunk project that is the Eastside Extension.

That's the problem here, if MARTA is convinced to step back on the Eastside Extension, all other proposed projects will have to be restudied intensely, along with the infill stations, the Southside rail, and more, pushing back any progress for _at least_ ten years.

Just ask the experts. **Former VP of Planning at Beltline Inc. Beth McMillan** posted in the [AJC](https://www.ajc.com/opinion/opinion-redirecting-focus-of-service-away-from-eastside-trail-along-beltline-would-major-setback-costing-millions/5NLPEFT6D5ACBGIBD32CYRFRJQ/) this statement:

> Halting this progress now would waste millions of dollars and set the project back significantly. Redirecting the focus to a different corridor would require another decade of study and design before construction could begin — essentially delaying any transit construction on the Beltline by 10-plus years.

If we're being real, the density along the Southside Trail is just not there, and the Murphy Crossing project that this would anchor around would not bring in nearly as many riders as what we would see on the Eastside Beltline. [MARTA studied the infill stations already, and found that they were not worth the cost in 2016.](<https://itsmarta.com/uploadedFiles/MARTA_101/Why_MARTA/Moremarta/More%20MARTA%20Atlanta%20Technical%20Summary%20(appendices%20included).pdf>) And, it would take decades to reach the current state that the Eastside Trail is in.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/33.jpg)

Again, the proposed projects by the Mayor **do not** have any planning for funding mechanism in place. **I've got to reiterate** – the Eastside Extension is **already studied**, **already funded**, and **shovel ready** for next year. Seriously, its so easy to just build this now. All in all, this is a classic [Atlanta Wa](https://atlantastudies.org/2021/10/04/the-atlanta-way-repression-mediation-and-division-of-black-resistance-from-1906-to-the-2020-george-floyd-uprising/)y bait and switch right in front of the public, flat out.

## Case Study on Charlotte Rail Trail

Ultimately, there's two futures for the Atlanta Beltline. One, that continues as is as a investment project like the New York City High Line, and another that completes the goal of a transpiration corridor. We can see a fantastic case study of this only 300 miles away from Atlanta, in the Charlotte Rail Trail.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/36.jpg)

Charlotte has been consistently building Light Rail since 1998, where they approved a half penny sales tax to fund light rail transit over several decades. Just like More MARTA!

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/34.jpg)

But most critically, they built Charlotte's LNYX Blue line that follows along Charlotte's version of the Beltline–the Rail Trail. It's an extremely successful alignment heading south from Downtown, featuring housing, mixed use, a path, and a light rail line. Sound familiar?

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/35.jpg)

[If we go back in time to when the Blue Line was opening, we see a similar discourse that we're seeing here in Atlanta](https://benjaminschneider.substack.com/p/the-triumph-and-tragedy-of-light). Political leaders and anti-transit campaigns warned the Blue Line would be a [white elephant](https://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_cha_2008-08a.htm), and that the project's cost of $465 million 2007 dollars was a terrible investment. That's almost twice as much as the Atlanta Eastside Extension, but they built it anyway.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/38.jpg)

However, they were dead wrong – the Blue Line along the Rail Trail saw almost double ridership expectations, seeing almost 50% more than the projected 9,000 weekday riders.

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/37.jpg)

And when they opened the $1.1 billion extension of the Blue Line in 2018, ridership exploded even more so, [seeing over 27,000 weekday riders.](https://www.axios.com/local/charlotte/2019/04/09/with-58-million-riders-and-3-5-billion-in-development-the-blue-line-is-one-of-charlottes-biggest-success-stories-162599) Today, rail transit along the Rail Trail is one of Charlottes biggest success stories, in the middle of the [sprawl capital of the country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgZcQIp4CL0), leading to [$2.8 billion in economic development](https://www.charlottenc.gov/files/sharedassets/cats/v/1/cats-docs/2030_transit_corridor_system_plan.pdf) along its 3.5 mile corridor.

## What's the right answer?

To close out here, [in my opinion, we should continue with the Eastside Extension, and trust the planning experts at Atlanta Beltline Inc. and MARTA.](https://www.ajc.com/opinion/opinion-redirecting-focus-of-service-away-from-eastside-trail-along-beltline-would-major-setback-costing-millions/5NLPEFT6D5ACBGIBD32CYRFRJQ/)

Doubling down, the Eastside Extension _only costs ~$230 million dollars,_ a seriously relative bargain for the density of people within its path ad the areas popularity, especially compared to other transportation projects: the Mayor's four MARTA infill stations are estimated at _[~$801 million](https://atlanta.urbanize.city/post/new-marta-infill-stations-massively-expensive-letter-editor)_, Clifton Corridor's BRT option at ~_[$1.3 billion](https://saportareport.com/marta-kills-clifton-corridor-rail-option-moves-ahead-on-bus-alternatives/columnists/johnruch/)_, or even GDOT's [~**_$9.5 billion_**](https://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/metro-atlanta-residents-get-new-details-on-proposed-i-285-top-end-express-lanes-project/65400) express lanes for I-285 (that will only reduce traffic by 8% 🙄).

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/40.jpg)

**This ~$230 million is already funded, already designed for $20 million of that cost, and shovel ready for next year.** We are in the middle of a **long-term plan** to bring rail to in-town Atlanta, and we should **not** sabotage this goal. [Not Atlanta Beltline spending $3 million on a vaporware, low capacity self-driving pod pilot program for the World Cup.](https://atlanta.urbanize.city/post/beltline-autonomous-driverless-vehicle-route-open-next-year)

![](/assets/video/beltline-rail-opposition/42.jpg)

So lets get the proof of concept built, the most prime for success transit route in the entirety of Atlanta, the Eastside Extension, and prove that Atlanta **can** be a world class city.

### Get Involved

Now, we need to make sure the mayor, Beltline Inc., MARTA, and your city council member know how important this is to the public. Another good way to get involved is with Beltline Rail Now – they're the only organization in Atlanta taking Beltline Transit seriously in the city.

### Closing

The fact of the matter is, Atlanta will continue to be an unserious city as long as we continue to be unserious about our transportation. The way to success is more urban infill, more density and mixed uses, and more public transportation to efficiently connect the dense parts of our city with reliable transportation. Until then, Atlanta will be as unserious as ever, and never achieve that dream of being a global city it set out to be in 1996.
