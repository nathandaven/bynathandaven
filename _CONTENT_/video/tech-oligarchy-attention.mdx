We all know modern social media is a problem, but no one is really doing anything about it. Twitter sucks, Instagram sucks, TikTok sucks. For real, my screen time has been upwards of 6 hours a day since before I can even remember.

But let's be real, the past few months have been some of the most exhausting news cycles we've had in a long time. And I feel like a lot of us have been brain rotting even harder to deal with it.

![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0040.jpg "POV: rotting")

So lately I've been learning why we are so damn addicted to our phones and social media, and trying to find ways to realistically minimize the brain rot, without going full monk.

Now, I want to share with you my findings, and find out how to finally touch some grass.

## **What is the state of our online platforms, and how did we end up here?**

The internet is likely one of the most impactful changes humans have experienced, and has made anything and everything accessible, any place, any time, anywhere. It's hard to imagine a world without being able to search any question on Google, or now ask an LLM to do it for us.

### Historical fears of technology

However, the onset of the internet isn't the first time that technology has impacted the ways humans communicate and spend their time. Over and over again, humans have radically transformed the ways they interact with the world.

![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/luddite.jpg)

Luddites were famous for destroying newfangled textile machinery, in a movement against the automation of their jobs in the 19th century. Today, they may seem crazy, but looking back you can really see some similarities to today. [Some major examples of how communication and media have been met with fear include:](https://slate.com/technology/2010/02/a-history-of-media-technology-scares-from-the-printing-press-to-facebook.html)

- **Socrates warned that written word** would "_create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories._"
- **In the 18th century,** as newspapers spread, it was warned that print "_socially isolated readers and detracted from the spiritually uplifting group practice of getting news from the pulpit._"
- **When radio arrived**, it was blamed for "_distracting children from their reading at school and diminishing their performance._"
- **Television** was famously feared for "_hurting radio, conversation, reading, and the patterns of family living._"
- **And when computers and the internet itself** arrived on our desks, they said the "_Facebook generation would not be able to form relationships._" Harsh, huh?

Honestly, some of these claims hold merit, but looking back, I think most would argue that these advancements have had an overall net good on society. There are pros and cons to every major change we make to our interpersonal relationships. We are smarter and more connected than we have ever been.

### **Examples of overreach**

But that's not to say that all is well. Now that we have fully connected computers everywhere we go, we have reached a point where we are inseparable from our devices and the internet. In a perfect, non-late-stage capitalist world, this would probably be brilliant. However, what do we do when the information network becomes owned and controlled by _the_ _literal oligarchal coalition between tech CEOs and the White House_?

Recent events have shown the true power Big Tech companies have over American politics, and through that, its influence on the world at large. Some examples include:

- #### **Twitter**

  [Neo-nazi Elon Musk’s](https://www.jphilll.com/p/elon-musks-premeditated-fascism) purchase of Twitter transformed it into a [“free speech” cesspool, allowing rapid misinformation and unfettered hate speech, leading to the 2024 Trump campaign’s success,](https://youtube.com/watch?v=GZ5XN_mJE8Y&t=844) and his satirical appointment as "First Buddy" to the president.

  Anyone who uses this app knows that it is an [absolutely hostile place to hang out in, filled with bots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ5XN_mJE8Y), [misinformation, crypto scams,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EbV7kyiKZA) and an algorithm that pushes [a verified badge, pay-to-win, hate speech agenda.](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/17/24298669/musk-trump-endorsement-x-boosting-republican-posts-july-algorithm-change)

  <Video src="-VfYjPzj1Xw" />

- #### **TikTok**

  TikTok is used by over [**1 BILLION** users worldwide](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696281/tiktok-1-billion-users), and [170 million just in the US. ](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346961/tiktok-shut-down-banned-in-the-us) Recent events of TikTok being forced to divest from Chinese ownership in the US, or get shut down, [have led to TikTok weird praising of President Trump, and users have already reported massive algorithm changes pretty much overnight.](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tiktok-ban-da11df6d59c17e2c17eea40c4042386d)

  And now rumors suggest [Elon Musk or Mr. Beast](https://time.com/7209861/who-will-buy-tiktok-meet-contenders-mrbeast-elon-musk-billionaires/) will buy or have a significant stake in US-based TikTok. No matter the outcome, conservative, free (hate) speech driven algorithms will win, and have intense control over public opinion.

  ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0038.jpg)

- #### **Instagram**

  Instagram, once a photo-sharing app, now serves as the primary means of connection for my generation. Meta has over and over again stolen other apps’ defining features, to kill and absorb it into its own mega-corporation. First buying Instagram and WhatsApp, then adopting Snapchat's killer “stories” feature, and most recently forcing short-form Reels down our throats has transformed the app into an AI-generated, vertical video mess.

  [Meta's monopoly over the social networking world is brazen, anticompetitive, and outright toxic,](https://www.reuters.com/legal/meta-will-face-antitrust-trial-over-instagram-whatsapp-acquisitions-2024-11-13/) as they train AI models on our faces, and sell that data to advertisers and [generate fake profiles in our likeness.](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/3/24334946/meta-ai-profiles-instagram-facebook-bots) And [Mark Zuckerberg's new hair rizzler perm](https://www.jphilll.com/p/were-ruled-by-losers) should not distract you from what he's doing behind the scenes: cozying up to the Trump administration alongside other Big Tech CEOs, [dismantling DEI policies, and removing fact-checking from its platforms](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mark-zuckerberg-dei-policies-meta-facebook-rcna186729), all in a bid to monopolize on TikTok's ban and avoid government intervention.

Unfortunately, being a user of these platforms all directly support the power-grab missions of this [technocratic oligarchy](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/whats-wrong-with-technocracy/).  No matter your politics, it’s unsettling what these platforms are doing with our data and likeness, that we feed it every, single, day.

## Anti-Sociality of Social Media, and Misinformation

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db513.htm), more than half of teenagers have _daily_ screen times of 4 hours or more. I believe it. iPad kids are a meme of the times at this point. But adults are also developing addictive relationships with their phones, according to [Simon Kemp of DataReportal](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-global-overview-report), adults on average spend 5-7 hours _daily_ on the internet, depending on age. And 95% of people have visited social media websites in the past month of usage.

![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/internetuse.png "via [Simon Kemp of DataReportal](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-global-overview-report)")

Now considering this, I think it's pretty common knowledge how negative social media can be for mental health. In so many ways, social media is quite the opposite, anti-social media.

Everyone has different experiences, but I think everyone has felt negative feelings from social media apps, including depression, FOMO, loneliness, dread, despair, and more. It's a major concern for our younger populations — there really is so much drama that has occurred just because of apps like Instagram.

I mean it's a real issue: [Seattle's Public School System filed a 91-page lawsuit against Big Tech social media companies for this exact reason.](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/08/1147735477/seattles-schools-are-suing-tech-giants-for-harming-young-peoples-mental-health)  And another example, [Decatur High School here in Georgia has deployed anti-smartphone bags so kids can focus in school, through a company called Yondr](https://decaturish.com/2024/07/decatur-high-school-to-collect-students-cell-phones-at-beginning-of-each-class/).

Anyway, my point is negativity does way better on social media, it breeds in a much stronger way. Driving more clicks is the name of the game, and this is a major problem when it comes to misinformation.

The old adage used to be "_can't trust what you see online_," but that increasingly has become less and less true for many.  [People increasingly trust their social media feeds, due to these "For You" style algorithms that serve us personalized content that traps us in echo chambers of similar viewpoints.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/10/16/republicans-young-adults-now-nearly-as-likely-to-trust-info-from-social-media-as-from-national-news-outlets/)

It basically confirmation bias happening over and over again, convincing people that their world views are the mainstream world view. I mean really, [this is literally the alt-right pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3_O91gyj9o) in a nutshell, but it happens on all sides of the political spectrum. [There's literally a term for it, called SMIP: "Social Media Induced Polarization," that has been shown to amplify confirmation bias.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8604707/)

![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0039.jpg "AI generated cats on Instagram Reels")

This is an increasingly bigger problem as AI-generated content has flooded these feeds. AI-generated slop has become much easier to stomach by normal users, as more and more slop infests our timelines.

It’s become so bad that the [dead internet theory practically rings true: that bots and fake content are used to control the population, minimize organization, and keep the status quo.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/01/16/the-dead-internet-theory-explained/) And honestly, not to be a Luddite, but the major social media platforms are **absolutely forcing slop down our throats** to maximize ad revenue and optimize shareholder returns.

We've reached the point of no return, and personally, I'm tired of it! I don't want to crawl through the slop and noise all day just for the rare funny meme or important news update.

## **Why are social platforms so good at capturing our attention?**

The problem is, these platforms are so ingrained in our society at this point that it's hard to even imagine not using them to some extent. I think a lot of us remember when social media _wasn't addictive,_ and it was, you know, just a website.

That's why, to understand why these apps keep us hooked, we need to understand their design paradigms. By understanding some of the ways our psychology is influenced from the designer's perspective, we can understand how to battle these influences.

To begin, all this starts with what's known as [Axiomatic Design Theory](https://www.axiomaticdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/develop-habit-forming-products-based-on-the-axiomatic-desig_2016_procedia-ci.pdf): a design process that uses a top-down matrix to analyze _how_ customer needs translate into _design parameters_ and _functional requirements_.

![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0007.jpg)

Basically, this paradigm was adapted into what's known as the **Hook Model**, an adapted version of Axiomatic Design that aims to maximize habit-forming products. There are four steps to the Hook Model:

1. First, the **trigger** that initiates user behavior.
2. Secondly, the simple **action** taken in response to the trigger.
3. Which leads to **rewarded** positive feedback for taking the action.
4. And lastly, **investment**, a final small commitment that increases the likelihood of returning to the product.

### Hook Model in Modern Online Experiences

**So looking at this cycle,** we can see [lots of features of modern social media experiences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370822459_A_Case_Study_on_Applications_of_the_Hook_Model_in_Software_Products), some examples including:

- **Pull to refresh,** introduced by Tweetie and later adopted by Twitter, created a “slot machine”-like experience where users pull to refresh to receive a reward, loading new content. The user is invested because even if there's barely any new content, the screen will update with new posts.
- **Algorithmic, infinite feeds** remove the user’s awareness of the end of scrolling, allowing them to continue indefinitely. Instead of needing to refresh at the top of the screen, users can scroll continuously, knowing the app will pull in content from accounts the user doesn’t even follow.
- **Vertical video and immediate playback** further enhance this experience. Users don’t have to read or commit to what they want to watch, as they can swipe and get a new high-dopamine video. There’s no visual indicator of how far they've scrolled down a page in this format, which makes it nearly impossible for the user to realize how long they've spent on the platform.
- **And this is just the tip of the iceberg**: notifications by default, trending pages, likes and view counts, follower counts, daily stories, shopping features, and more are all designed to keep us engaged and pull you back into these apps.

### We've forgotten how to be bored.

Really though, I think you already knew all of this. We all know and feel how unfun the internet has become. But the unfortunate outcome of this is that we've all been trained to become uncomfortable with boredom.

The quote "_time spent scrolling, is time we spend not aging_," is too real — we have literally forgotten how to think, how to be bored, how to form our own opinions. It's so easy to just pick up our phones and have a streamer tell us how to feel about a headline, have an influencer tell us what clothes to buy next, and spend three hours just trying to catch up on all the slop stories, posts, and videos our friends repost.

I can't blame anyone either though. The world sucks, and most of it is out of our control, and all of it is so exhausting. Maybe it’s just fine to brain rot to AI-generated cats dancing on your screen. However, I think a lot of people are kind of feeling the same way, they don't want to do this all day, and there has to be a better way.

## **So how am I permanently divesting from doomscrolling, while still being connected?**

So, here's my experience over the past few months trying to limit my screen time. I think with a little practice, we can all learn how to resist these platforms, and force them to be simply utilities in our life, like Google, or Wikipedia. By realizing the factors of design that make these apps addictive: feeds, notifications, and more, we can take control back from these addictive platforms.

- **First, start with screen time features,** like Apple and Android's Screen Time feature, the free [Screen Zen](https://www.screenzen.co) app, and maybe even the paid [Brick](https://getbrick.app/?srsltid=AfmBOop5ONaTAPnZWIoOOxF4O_uhDhTUHWoqnFNA-n2_Khp1MRoV0zrm) product.
  - These can help to initially learn discipline to avoid these apps, but you still have to work to change your habits with these tools. So, replace scrolling with better consumption: reading, video games, exercise, social gatherings, what have you.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0010.jpg)
- **Second, make your smartphone as dumb as possible.** While dumb phones are becoming popular, I think that's a consumerist solution, and you can make your current smartphone dumb while still keeping useful features.
  - First, delete unnecessary apps and use browser versions only. You can then install extensions to block feeds and make the websites truly utilitarian.
  - I’m using “[SocialFocus](https://socialfocus.app)” for all the big websites, I also use “[IGPlus](https://weblxapplications.com/igp/)” for Instagram, “[Control Panel for Twitter](https://soitis.dev/control-panel-for-twitter)", “[Sink It](https://gosinkit.com)” for Reddit, and “[Untrap](https://untrap.app)” for YouTube. These block suggested posts, ads, and the main feed, making websites properly utilitarian and not tempting.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0011.jpg)
  - Next, block unnecessary notifications in your phone, and also consider using the notification summary feature. Like, be super strict with this, I only have messaging apps, phone calls, and banking enabled.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0012.jpg)
  - Some other tips are to use grayscale on all screens to make displays less engaging.  And, set a designated place for smartphone usage, and especially _don't sleep with the dang thing_! Keep it away from your bedside.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0015.jpg "Try to find a designated place for your phone, like this drawer I'm using!")
- **Next, in general, we need to move away from platforms** like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, as I've described previously. Luckily, there are real alternatives propping up that still let you keep in touch that aren't owned by Big Tech.
  - For **microblogging**, [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) and [Mastodon](https://urbanists.social/) are Twitter alternatives that are legitimately mainstream now.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0017.jpg)
  - For **photo sharing**, I'd say [Flickr](https://flickr.com), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/), and the upcoming [Flashes](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:24kqkpfy6z7avtgu3qg57vvl) app by Bluesky are looking like good alternatives to Instagram and Facebook, and I hope more people start switching.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0018.jpg)
  - For **video content**, consider supporting creators directly through platforms like [Patreon](https://patreon.com), [Nebula](https://nebula.tv), and [Means TV](https://means.tv). Plus, you can further your parasocial relationships with people like me!
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0019.jpg)
- **However, even better than all of these platforms  is setting up an RSS reader.** RSS is the old-school way of subscribing to pages you care about, and it's a great way to stay in the loop without the FOMO of being off social media.
  - I personally use [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com), a web client, and connect it to the open-source app [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) on my phone and computer.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0024.jpg)
  - This is honestly better than a social media feed because it puts the full articles, local and national news, blog posts, YouTube videos, what have you, right there in the reader.
  - You aren't being advertised to like on a social platform; you're just seeing the work itself, and you can tweak it exactly to your liking. I only have to check my feed once a day and then clear out the inbox.
- **Lastly, one big concern is receiving messages on these platforms, like Instagram.** Lots of people my age use DMs to communicate, but luckily, there are solutions.
  - The easiest is enabling emails for messages. This would allow you to still be notified if you receive an important message regardless of platform, without needing the app installed.
  - For Facebook and Instagram, the “[Meta Business Suite](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-business-suite/get-started)” app lets you answer messages and make posts without providing a feed.
    ![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0026.jpg)
    You just need to set your account to a business/creator account and attach a Facebook page, and you should be able to use this app instead of the normal app. Another option is Beeper; however, I am wary of the security of this app.

Alright, that was a lot, but honestly, probably the most important takeaway to digital minimalism is replacing all that fake interaction with real-life interactions.

Like, literally touch grass: see your friends, go to events, find real communities to engage in, and get involved with your local neighborhood. They can even be online, but I think finding interesting things to be a part of in real life is going to be so much better and more effective than posting online.

For example, I usually talk about cities here on the channel, and making moves in your local community is in many ways way more impactful than yapping here on a YouTube channel. I am no expert, just sharing some ideas I've had that I'm trying to implement in my own life.

But I've found a lot of success here, being able to drop my screen time from easily 6+ hours a day to only about 2-3 hours a day, and I can recommend it!

## **Concluding and Announcements**

That's it for this one - but I do have an exciting announcement for the channel!

My goal for 2025 is to do at least one main channel video a month on average — which is why I'm opening up a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/nathandaven) account and enabling [YouTube memberships](https://youtube.com/@nathandaven/join) on the channel.

![](/assets/video/tech-oligarchy-attention/PRJ:%20Doomscrolling%20v7%20-%20final%204-0032.jpg)

The reason for this is twofold:

- **For one,** Patreon is the best way to support me if you like my videos. These videos are a lot of work, and memberships will help me stay consistent and supplement the surprisingly pitiful ad revenue!
- **And second,** Patreon seems like a decent platform that doesn’t capitalize on your attention. It prioritizes creators and allows me to earn an income that isn’t driven by advertising, algorithms, or brain rot. But, I will mirror most of the features to YouTube Memberships as well, and we will see how it goes.

Please consider these options as more of a donation for my work. Right now, there are few things I can reliably commit to: namely, posting full uncut interviews I do here on the channel, along with priority input from y'all on future videos, and occasional update posts from me on what I'm working on.

So, absolutely no pressure here - I think it's so weird that anyone would join a Patreon or membership for me. Just watching and subscribing is already so awesome, thank you so much.

Up next, we'll be back to our roots here, and I've got a series coming up on Amtrak that should be up semi-shortly. Happy holidays and new year, and looking forward to another great year here on the channel. 🙂 Hope y'all liked this one, and thanks for watching!
