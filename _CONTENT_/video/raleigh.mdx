What do you do when your city's population explodes practically overnight? How about practically doubling in population, from around [270,000 to nearly 500,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina#cite_note-DecennialCensus-110) within city limits? Well, that's what just happened to Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina over the past twenty years.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0001.jpg)

With such unprecedented growth, it's struggled with the many growing pains that come with all this growth. Housing affordability, transportation, land use, and more have pushed Raleigh to quickly urbanize from it's humble roots. In the last video, we explored the incredible success of North Carolina's passenger rail service, but today, we're talking about my destination.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0022.jpg "Raleigh, North Carolina")

Excitingly, today I have a special guest, the former Raleigh mayor and city council-member [May-Ann Baldwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-ann-baldwin-b0641725/), who infamously known as the _[Notorious MAB](https://raleighmag.com/2024/10/a-look-at-baldwins-tenure/)_ for her progressive efforts for widespread zoning reform, affordable housing, and public transportation investment, to help us understand how the region is handling these challenges.

So let's dive into what Raleigh's efforts to curb the negative effects of it's population expansion, and see what other cities can learn from Raleigh's explosion.

## Context on Raleigh, NC

While for much of history Raleigh has been a somewhat smaller town, since the 1960's the [Raleigh-Durham-Cary CSA](https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/econ/ec2012/csa/EC2012_330M200US450M.pdf) has been increasingly steadily in population due to the regions shift from traditional industries such as agriculture and textiles, to a explosion of growth in research and educational industries, especially following the establishment of the Research Triangle Park and growing success of universities such as NC State, Duke, and UNC.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0003.jpg)

Like I said, Raleigh's city population has nearly doubled in the past few decades, but the metro area of the Raleigh-Durham-Cary CSA has also practically doubled, from **[1.3 million to 2.1 million](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/33000US450-raleigh-durham-cary-nc-csa/)** since the year 2000.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0006.jpg)

Raleigh, like most other American cities, expanded much in peak car-dependent, post-WWII suburban expansion, which has allowed the region to sprawl into an extremely low density region.

The problem is, the Raleigh region's urban form of culdesacs, single family homes, and highways, and its car-centric transportation system, is not keeping up with the recent explosion of growth. [And it's only exacerbating the historical injustices of the past](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/raleigh-elections-progressive-development-affordable-housing/). Raleigh's black schools were purposefully located near quarries and landfills in southern Raleigh, segregating Black populations and blocking them from mortgage loans in the new suburbs of northern Raleigh post-WWII, locking many communities into these neighborhoods to present day.

Not to mention, [urban renewal](https://www.digitalnc.org/primary-source-sets/urban-development-and-renewal/?#view) locked in many of these injustices, outright destroying some black neighborhoods in the process. For example, [Fourth Ward in South Raleigh](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article291229525.html) was completely destroyed by freeway construction for Western Boulevard, and in a sick twist of irony, the eastern side of the road was renamed MLK Boulevard – ironically an overbuilt road that displaced a massive black community.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0007.jpg)

Other infamous examples include other [Urban Renewal projects](https://www.digitalnc.org/primary-source-sets/urban-development-and-renewal/?#view) such as the Beltway and Capitol Boulevard, destroying blocks of downtown and neighborhoods to facilitate car-dependent, suburban expansion.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0008.jpg)

Now, the current meta for the [wealthy, predominantly white homeowner class](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/27/upshot/diversity-housing-maps-raleigh-gentrification.html) over the past decades is to purchase cheaper housing in these [urban neighborhoods, renovate, and drive up housing prices](https://researchblog.duke.edu/2021/02/09/student-team-quantifies-housing-discrimination-in-durham/) in these historic areas often leading to [displacement](https://www.ncjustice.org/publications/the-risks-of-gentrification-in-north-carolina-a-cautionary-note-on-opportunity-zones-and-policies-that-accelerate-growth-without-community-benefit/) of locals, without actually improving the housing shortage.

### Introducing Mayor Mary-Ann

So that's the situation. And now, in a time where we need to build **a lot** of housing, it's extremely complicated. How do we build housing in a way that doesn't continue to harm these historically disinvented communities negatively, while also investing in and improving these communities? Can we positively invest in communities, aka [gentrify](https://www.ncjustice.org/publications/the-risks-of-gentrification-in-north-carolina-a-cautionary-note-on-opportunity-zones-and-policies-that-accelerate-growth-without-community-benefit/), without creating displacement? It's a lot of questions.

Which is why I'm excited to have [Mary-Ann Baldwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-ann-baldwin-b0641725), former city council-member at large, mayor, and one of the primary leaders answering these questions over the past fifteen years on this video.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0005.jpg)

> _Hi, my name is Mary Ann Baldwin. I am actually the former Mayor of Raleigh, but I guess you're never a former one once you're Mayor. I have served from 2007 to 2017 on the Raleigh City Council at large, and then was elected Mayor in 2019 and served for five years._
>
> _So my term was officially over in December, and yes, I can breathe again!_

Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin spent much of her political career going against urban conservatives in Raleigh politics, infamously getting her nickname as the _Notorious MAB_ for going against establishment views and the NIMBY leaning "Council of No."

Her goals over have primarily been concerned with addressing the housing shortage, constructing more affordable housing, and creating more alternative transportation options for all – I asked her what's making Raleigh so popular.

> _First off, we’re the second fastest growing region in the country, which tells you something. To me, it means our quality of life is good._
>
> _The big thing a lot of people talk about is our parks and greenway system. It is a leader in the country. And our job sector is really strong and very diverse. ...because of government, because of education, three major research universities, again, huge job opportunities. We have people coming from all over the world to teach here._
>
> _I would say positive business environment, great quality of life. It's got that small town kind of feel, even though we're a big city now. But I hope we never lose that small town feel and culture, because I think that really sets us apart from the rest of the world._
>
> _I think the big challenge is infrastructure and connectivity. We want to make sure that this isn't just about Raleigh, it really is about our region. We are unique in that we have Research Triangle Park in the middle of our three, four major cities, Raleigh, Carrboro, Durham, Chapel Hill. So you have this major research park in the middle of all that, and people commute into the park. So it's not like, say, New York City, where people are commuting into the center city. ...So we have focused a lot on how we can connect as a region._

## Economic Drivers

One major way Raleigh has been taking advantage of its increased population growth is by heavily investing in sports and tourism. Mary-Ann has routinely said she believes in sports heavily as a revenue stream for the city to fund other projects. The biggest being the **Carolina Hurricanes** – an incredibly successful hockey team – with their home stadium being in Raleigh at the Lenovo Center (formerly PNC Arena).

<Video src="qUbrRyW7abU" />

Mary-Ann helped secure [$300 million in public funds](https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/08/01/pnc-arena-raleigh-renderings-renovation) for an ambitious plan to transform this car-dependent, antiquated stadium into an [entertainment district](https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2024/09/24/lenovo-center-future-new-rezoning-downtown-renderings), quoted to be inspired by the Atlanta Battery, and therefore increase tax revenues for other city projects.

<Video src="bTlz7TM7Gx8" />

> _Well, when we went to Atlanta on the Raleigh Chamber Intercity visit, I think it really got people's attention when they said, "Yeah, we bring in $3 billion a year in economic development." And I've been talking about sports as an economic driver, but I think that's when people went, "Wow, it really hit home that this is a thing._
>
> _And when you look at PNC Arena, now the Lenovo Center, during that time, you know, past five years, they brought in, think about $3 billion as well. And that really makes a difference. And I don't think people are really paying attention._
>
> _I just sit there and go, "Hmm, if you can do that over five years, imagine what we can do in a year." If we have this... like, if we realize the vision, when we first brought forward the whole interlocal agreement, the site was chosen at Unstate Land, it was... Everybody said, "Oh, development will happen around it." No. And in part because the land is owned by the state. So it's impossible. And we didn't have anybody who was that interested._
>
> _And then along comes Tom Dundin, the owner of the Hurricanes. He obviously has seen the potential. You know, we've sold out. I think it's like 80, 70-some odd games in a row. I mean, we've got a record going, and he sees the support of the community._
>
> _And he's willing to make those investments. I often... I call this the largest economic development project in the history of our city. Because between the $300 million that we're going to put into improving and expanding the Lenovo Center, you know, Tom is willing to invest... It's probably going to be a billion dollars when all of a sudden done to create this entertainment district._
>
> _And the whole idea is to have sports betting there, have retail, and office space. There will be apartments, but also they've agreed to a certain percentage of affordable housing. When you go out to the arena now, there's nothing to do. That's why everybody tailgates. You know, a great NC State tradition that was carried over with the Hurricanes._

Alongside the Hurricanes, women's soccer is also huge in the region via the Carolina Courage. Women's soccer is one of the fastest growing sports in the world, and with the construction and expansion of their home stadium WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, a suburb of Raleigh, this has only brought additional attention to Raleigh and the Triangle.

<Video src="Oin_13izm90" />

> _But I also want to say, like, my big passion too is Carolina Courage. Women's soccer is like the fastest-growing sport in the world. I love going to the Courage games and cheering them on. I think it's inspirational and aspirational. I see young girls there. I know they play soccer and they're cheering it on and they're going crazy. But for them, seeing is believing. And often I think, "Oh, God, they're sitting there watching this, and they're thinking, "Maybe that could be me one day."_
>
> _And I just feel very strongly, we have a great women's soccer team. We're the best in the world. We should embrace that and we should look for ways we can find a home for them that brings women's soccer into a bigger picture here._

There's criticism to be had here too – focusing on sports and tourism doesn't always guarantee positive effects on the community at large. The Battery in Atlanta, quoted as inspiration for this project, still costing Cobb County taxpayers [$15 million a year](https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2022/03/10/cobb-taxpayers-braves-stadium) according to KSU economist [J.C. Bradbury](https://www.kennesaw.edu/coles/centers/markets-economic-opportunity/docs/bradbury-cobb-report-march-2022.pdf). But it will likely be better land-use than what's there now, which is a stadium surrounded by parking lots, and will increase the tax base for other projects in the city.

## Transportation + Land Use

### Passenger Rail

#### Amtrak Piedmont

In my last video with Donald Arant, we talked a lot about the Piedmont corridor specifically and how impactful that's been for greater North Carolina. To keep it brief: the Amtrak Piedmont is a service operating between Charlotte and Raleigh North Carolina, with travel times of around three hours end to end. This service has crushed ridership record year after year over the past decade, and has been an incredible bipartisan success for the state.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0010.jpg)

With Raleigh being one end of the line, they clearly got a lot to do with it. Look at the corridor, it's the banking capital and largest city by population in North Carolina on one end of the line, and the largest research and university center, and second largest city by population in North Carolina on the other end. Now with trains running every two hours all day, and travel time being only three hours, its a slam dunk no brainer.

> _The other thing the state has done, they've done a great job of working with Amtrak to expand our service as well. So they are coming online with another line, so to increase frequency and whatnot._
>
> _They set records last year, Amtrak did. And it was interesting too, when we had the U.S. Open here in Pinehurst, Amtrak said, okay, we're going to run a train out there. It sold out in a day. And I think they may have added more service._
>
> _But that tells you the demand. People want to ride a train. And it can't just be the Northeast Corridor or California. Like I said, we're the second fastest growing region in the country. If they're not looking at us for improving rail service, come on, who are you looking at? But also, we have to do our part because that's where the BRT comes in and building up the density to help something like that be successful._
>
> _But also other things I'm excited about is we were awarded grants. The state was to connect, to study connecting other areas. So for instance, Raleigh and Wilmington. I mean, when people saw that, they went nuts. Like, I could go to Wilmington for the weekend and blah, blah, blah. And yeah, and, you know, get to the beach, get there conveniently._

#### Raleigh Union and Bus Terminal Expansion

Raleigh actually has a fairly brand new Amtrak station right in Downtown. It was constructed in 2008, and is currently being expanded to a larger mobility hub for local and regional busses, and has been a huge part of Downtown Raleigh's revitalization effort and popularity.

> _Well, we had a really exciting year in Raleigh when, well, I would say the past two years, we had Secretary Pete come here twice and Doug Amoff, the second gentleman. First off, to celebrate Amtrak's anniversary, but also at Raleigh Union Station and to see the Bus Terminal project._
>
> _Because I do have to say, Raleigh Union Station came together because Democrats and Republicans worked together to fund that. Senator Kay Hagan, the late great Senator Kay Hagan, she worked very hard on that. As did Tony Tata, who was our Secretary of Transportation at the time. Again, Democrats and Republicans working together for the same cause._
>
> _That happened because of them and the work that we did. I was very actively involved in that. And when I see that and then I see Russ Bus, that was Congressman David Price, who helped us secure that funding for GoTriangle._
>
> _What that's going to do, that's the point of, the point of connectivity for all of our BRT lines. Again, next door to a train station. So you make the trains more accessible, make it all easier to get around. It's in the heart of downtown. There's development happening around it, which is what we envisioned as well. So you have that and that mobility center will be priceless._

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0013.jpg "RUSBUS, the new bus facility.")

#### S-Line Funding

Northward of Raleigh, Amtrak service is also improving thanks to the S-Line project from the $1.1 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law last year.

<Video src="GxnJ67MAD58" />

This initial 17-mile segment is part of a larger vision to reconnect Raleigh and Richmond with faster, more efficient rail service. Once completed, the S-Line will shave 90 minutes off travel times between the two cities, making train trips to Washington, D.C. even quicker.

> _But then you, we had Secretary Pete come back. And that was so exciting because that was the announcement for the S line. The state is receiving $1.1 billion to make improvements along the tracks._
>
> _The whole idea is to shorten the route or the time it takes to get on the train from here to Richmond to DC. And the first leg is this $1.1 billion, which will connect Raleigh and Wake Forest. First peg in the line. And it is, first off, the connectivity that can happen between all our communities along the S-Line and Wake County is incredible. But the connectivity it can bring to the region all the way to DC is also incredible._
>
> _So I have to give a lot of credit to Julie White and Jason and others who work for the NCDOT rail division. They have been unbelievable when it comes to developing relationships, communications, collaboration, getting things done. And this is really a result of their hard work._

### Bus Rapid Transit + Density Corridors

Secondly though, and much more importantly, is Raleigh's Bus Rapid Transit plan. This plan is expansive, and combined with rezoning and redevelopment, should be massively impactful for effective planning.

#### Overview

Raleigh currently has a strictly local bus transit system, GoRaleigh, that mostly is focused on moving people into Downtown and out of Downtown. There's also GoTriangle, a regional bus service that connects the corners of the Triangle, Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill.

It's a pretty expansive local bus system, but Raleigh is severely lacking in rapid transportation options. Some routes could really use dedicated lanes to speed up transit. So in 2016, Wake County voters approved the [Wake County Transit Plan](https://www.goforwardnc.org/wake-county/), a plan for focused investment in public transit, calling for approximately 20 miles of transit lanes along four Bus Rapid Transit corridors that radiate cardinally from Downtown, North South East and West.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0014.jpg)

**What is Bus Rapid Transit?** Also known as BRT, this transit aims to offer a rail-like experience for a fraction of the cost With dedicated, _center running_ lanes, traffic priority, level boarding platforms, dedicated _bendy_ busses and off-platform fare collection, the service should be much quicker than existing bus service, and move way more people than current lines. Plus, in the future once density and demand improve, BRT can be converted to rail in some scenarios.

And as previously mentioned, these lines will center at the brand new Bus Terminal being constructed adjacent to Raleigh Union Station. This just makes a lot of sense – centralize regional rail travel right next to the entire Raleigh rapid transit system for easy last mile connections. Plus, regional BRT via GoTriangle to Durham, Chapel Hill, and more will centralize here as well, really compounding the benefits.

Mary-Ann is heavily credited for helping secure [$39 million in funding](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/construction-is-starting-on-the-bus-rapid-transit-line-along-new-bern-avenue-but-some-raleigh-residents-worry-it-will-do-more-harm-than-good/) for the the first BRT line on New Bern Avenue, heading east out of Raleigh. The area following New Bern is a historically black community, with important history and many long-time residents. The hope is improved transit will bring better transportation, safer streets, and more amenities to this underserved community.

> _We just got funding from the federal government for a mobility hub in the Triangle that will provide connectivity. And I think that that's really important. The state is doing a study on how we can connect regionally with bus rapid transit. BRT is something Raleigh has focused on, Chapel Hill is focusing on, and now Durham is focusing on. That's a way to build density and also improve, like, potential customers for rail transportation._
>
> _So we have our first line coming up on New Bern Avenue. And I think that's our most heavily used bus line. If all of a sudden people have a bus coming every 10 minutes, that improves reliability. I think it will improve congestion on the bus and also get people to their destinations quicker. So I think that that is the focus of what we're going to do._

#### Density on transit corridors

However, Bus Rapid Transit also goes twofold with land use. BRT is, no pun intended, a potentially massive vehicle for dense urban development. They're accomplishing this by rezoning lane on the transit corridors for mixed use and affordable housing development, hopefully packing on much more housing, retail, and destinations along the routes.

Transit works best when the land use surrounding the rapid transit is high - it increases the effectiveness of the service and compounds its benefits. For example, in 2023, GoTriangle, the regional transit authority between Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, have looked to bring rail transit between the Triangle's cities. However, the [FTA rejected funding for the project](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article278520104.html), citing that the region does not yet have the density for this project. Previously, in 2019, [light rail was also rejected between Durham and Chapel Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/163kr0w/triangle_commuter_rail_shelved_for_foreseeable/).

While unfortunate, the next step for these cities is obviously Bus Rapid Transit. BRT is more affordable per mile, and dedicated lanes can bring similar benefits at a fraction of the cost, and prove that the demand is there for transit. The hope is, by densifying with BRT within the cities, they can come back to rail in the future, with estimates saying within 10-20 years this could be possible. And Raleigh, the largest city of all of these, has the best chance at packing on housing along transit corridors. GoTriangle is also looking at BRT regionally as a next step.

> _But it also helps address growth because it addresses, for me, three things. Building more density along transit corridors increases housing. And then if you have BRT, it improves your transportation options. But that also addresses climate change. And I kind of feel very strongly if we can address all three in an area of high growth, that is the way to go._
>
> _So that's what I have focused on during my tenure as mayor is the infrastructure needs, how we can get there. And, you know, it's not easy because especially rail, like we looked at light rail as an option, cost a lot of money. And you have to have density along transit corridors for the FTA to approve funding for you._
>
> _So we're addressing that by, okay, here we go, building more density and then connecting to like Raleigh Union Station where people can catch the train. And what I would also love to see is a couple more trains from Amtrak to make it easier for us to get to places regionally._

#### Problems

Progress on Raleigh's BRT has been slow though, due to delays from COVID and contractor interest. In October 2023, funding was approved for the first line to begin construction, the New Bern Avenue line, which heads eastward out of Downtown Raleigh.

However, according to the [INDY](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/will-2025-be-the-year-construction-on-raleighs-first-bus-rapid-transit-line-finally-gets-off-the-ground/), nothing happened for _seven months_ as no contractor had come forward to start construction on the 10 stations and 3.3 miles of dedicated bus lanes along the 5.4-mile corridor. Fast forward to today, after a first attempt to split the project into two parts, now the project is split into _four segments!_

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0026.jpg)

Honestly, that's wild, and the timeline looks crazy. And as of March, I couldn't find any definitive news that contractors have been selected for the first quarter of the project. Additionally, according to the [News & Observer](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article302346354.html), leaders in the region, as most leaders are across the country, about the [$35 million in federal funding](https://www.transit.dot.gov/about/news/us-department-transportation-announces-35-million-grant-bus-rapid-transit-project) coming through for New Bern from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Allegedly, since the new federal administration is "Owning the Libs" by putting holds on Bipartisan Infrastructure Funding, they sent a letter to state legislature's to make sure the funding still comes through – not marking a promising timeline for transit in Wake County.

I don't want to doom too much here on the channel, but even with the countless delays on transit expansion in Raleigh, I'm hopeful construction will continue at some point soon.

## Smart Growth: Housing, Missing Middle, & Equity

Moving on, smart growth is another way Raleigh is doubling down on its population explosion. The real question is: how do we address the precedents of the past, while also building enough density to address the massive influx of people? Well, the bare minimum we can do is make it affordable for people, regardless of income, to continue living in the city as neighborhoods get more popular and desirable due to investment.

For example, parts of Raleigh's black community are concerned over the previously shown BRT plan. Many are concerned that BRT will rapidly raise property values and displace residents in its vulnerable communities along New Bern Avenue east of Raleigh, per the [INDY](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/white-raleigh-loves-wake-s-transit-plan-black-raleigh-sold/), while proponents say that this is a problem to be managed by land-use and the city, not by transportation.

When we have economic investment that often means **[gentrification](https://www.ncjustice.org/publications/the-risks-of-gentrification-in-north-carolina-a-cautionary-note-on-opportunity-zones-and-policies-that-accelerate-growth-without-community-benefit/)** as well. Which isn't inherently always bad, investment brings _better amenities_, _safer streets_, _increased affordable housing stock_, and more per the study done on New Bern Ave – but what is, is **displacement**. Displacement is preventable – we want people of all income levels and backgrounds to afford to live in the neighborhoods they work and play in and benefit from the improvements.

Communities want improvements and investment in their communities, but they don't want their housing prices [jacking up like crazy](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/54047/raleigh-nc/) due to artificial restrictions on housing density and price inflation. That's where Missing Middle Infill and Affordable Housing comes into play, two things Raleigh has been thinking a lot about over the past decade as their population explodes.

### The Missing Middle

The [Missing Middle](https://raleighnc.gov/planning/services/what-missing-middle) is a problem a lot of cities are struggling with. Much of Raleigh consists of single family zoned neighborhoods, which lock in zoning to single family, separated dwellings, and usually no retail. And historic neighborhoods built before single family zoning are high in demand, and locked out of construction due to historic preservation rules. Building higher density requires zoning changes, which often face strict opposition from neighbors for bad faith reasons, often referred to as NIMBY's, or "Not In My Backyard."

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0024.jpg)

> I campaigned on the whole issue of missing middle housing. It makes me crazy to think that, oh, we can only have single-family homes. When the fact of the matter is, most people's entrée into home ownership these days is a town home. And I don't know why people get so upset if there's -- like, somebody will build a McMansion next to them and that's okay.
>
> But they build town homes and it's like, oh, you have four connected walls and four town homes. That's not okay. No. That McMansion is affordable for one person. These four town homes probably affordable to a lot more people.

So what does the missing middle mean in Raleigh? It means everything missing between single family homes, and high density apartment buildings of course! This can be townhomes, duplexes, triplexes, cottage courts, and more, all now broadly legal thanks to [efforts by the city of Raleigh](https://raleighnc.gov/planning/services/faq-raleighs-missing-middle).

Raleigh did this by passing [TC-5-20](https://cityofraleigh0drupal.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/drupal-prod/COR22/TC-05-20-ORD.pdf) in Summer 2021 through City Council. This ordinance amended permitted more types of housing in residential neighborhoods, particularly duplexes and townhouses.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0016.jpg)

Then quickly came [TC-20-21](https://cityofraleigh0drupal.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/drupal-prod/COR22/TC-20-21-ORD.pdf) in Summer 2022, which the next step in a more flexible zoning code designed to allow for smaller homes on smaller lots and denser development near high-frequency transit.

![](/assets/video/raleigh/0018.jpg)

> _When I first was elected mayor, you could only build a town home in 20% of the city. That's absurd. And if you had a duplex and you knocked it down, you couldn't rebuild a duplex. So that means you had to rebuild a big McMansion._
>
> _The same was true of quads and triplexes. So now you can build these. When I first was elected mayor, the former council pretty much banned accessory dwelling units. That is one of the most affordable ways to build affordable housing._
>
> _Also, we couldn't build cottage courts. Cottage courts to me are more environmentally friendly because you have shared space and you don't have the same level of impervious surface. But also it's a better use of land and you can put more units on that land. So the missing middle piece for me is key._
>
> _And you know, here's the other thing too. When I think about this and people opposing like ADUs or duplexes or townhomes, whatnot, if you go to what I would call some of our most historic and desirable neighborhoods, this is the type of housing that is there. There are **duplexes**. There are **quads**. There are **triplexes**. There are **townhomes**. And it's like these existed for years and now all of a sudden it's not desirable. No, that's how neighborhoods used to be built. And I think having an open mind, but also being more welcoming to people is actually a good thing. It creates community and we need more of that._

Additionally, Raleigh in 2022 eased historic parking minimum requirements that brought parking requirements into the 21st century, [which flipped existing parking minimums to parking maximums, established bicycle parking requirements, and imposed environmental mitigations for any new developments which include excess parking.](https://parkingreform.org/2022/03/18/raleigh-joins-ranks-of-cities-with-no-costly-parking-mandates/) And even better news as of this month, looks like the entire [State of North Carolina may be passing similar legislation state-wide](https://www.axios.com/local/charlotte/2025/03/21/parking-lot-reform-north-carolina-water-pollution)!

But what did Raleigh see after doing these changes? Well, _explosions_ in housing supply. Thousands more buildings were permitted over 2021 and 2022, outpacing all permits over the previous decades. Now that's an impressive chart!

You may say, "Those new apartments are gonna be freaking expensive. It's _luxury apartments_ everywhere making the city unaffordable. How is this addressing rent?" And yes, you're right. But one aspect of bringing rent down is the concept of **[filtering](https://www.nmhc.org/globalassets/research--insight/research-reports/filtering-data/nmhc-research-foundation-filtering-2020-final.pdf)** – [the idea that these brand new multifamily buildings, will be the normal affordable apartments in five years](https://cityobservatory.org/what-filtering-can-and-cant-do/). That's why we have to constantly build housing – the rents will come down. And the reason rents are skyrocketing now, is because we weren't building enough housing to keep supply up in the past years.

> _Then you also have the whole idea of just when people move from one place into another, they move up, their space becomes available. It's called filtering. But that opens up more affordable housing to people too, things that you can't afford._

### Affordable Housing

The silver bullet isn't just the standard YIMBY narrative though: build, baby, build and rent will be low, low, low! While these zoning ordinances are meant to promote gentle infill in existing neighborhoods following market demand and help ease demand, they don't entirely ensure housing is affordable, especially for more vulnerable populations.

So, the city must alleviate this through both _dedicated housing projects_ and _financial incentives_ for affordable units at various income levels in market rate housing. As the state of North Carolina [does not allow inclusionary zoning enforcement of affordable units constructed in market rentals](https://triangleblogblog.com/2022/08/29/chapel-hills-inclusionary-zoning-policies-dont-work/) (exception here being for purchased property, [a legal grey area that Chapel Hill exists in](https://indyweek.com/news/eight-years-ago-chapel-hill-enacted-progressive-affordable-housing-policy-triangle.-failed./)), the city must **incentivize developers financially to include affordable units instead**. This is important to keep units affordable in case of rapidly increasing market rents or housing prices, as lower income families cannot survive dramatic price changes.

A major achievement of Mary-Ann's mayoral tenure was the [$80 million affordable housing bond in 2020](https://www.wunc.org/news/2020-11-04/raleigh-voters-approve-80m-affordable-housing-bond-largest-in-citys-history), a resolution that funded more affordable housing than Raleigh in decades: [funding private-public partnerships, tax credit projects, land banking along transit corridors, and homeowner financial assistance](https://indyweek.com/news/elections-news/endorsements-2020-housing-bond/), alongside her earlier work on city council.

> _So when I was on the council, one of the things I did was I advocated for a one-cent property tax dedicated to affordable housing. And at that time, I was the only person to speak up publicly in a council meeting and say, we have to do this and I support this. And once all the emails started flooding us, our inbox, the same, please, this is necessary. But I'm really proud of my advocacy and leadership on that because now that brings in $11 million a year. So that's steady income that we can use for affordable housing._

One affordable housing example garnering a lot of talk is the **[DMV project in eastern Raleigh](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/what-will-southeast-raleighs-former-dmv-site-become/)**, alongside the New Bern Ave BRT project and within vulnerable communities suffering from the effects of displacement. The city recently acquired it for $20 million, and is performing community engagement to see how to best use the property, with hopes of "balancing community needs with practical development." Some ideas include grocery, affordable housing, and more.

Another example is **[Moore Square](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/raleigh-council-accepts-funding-for-bus-rapid-transit-approves-redevelopment-south-of-moore-square/)** – a redevelopment project to bring housing and hotel units to Downtown and approved in late 2023. More than 500 housing units are planned, with 160 to 190 reserved for affordable housing. The units will be available to people making a mix of incomes, with 30 for 80% AMI, 70 units for 60% AMI, 30 for 50% AMI, and 24 for 30% AMI.

**What does AMI mean?** AMI is the "Area Media income," and is basically the median income level for a particular region, calculated annually by the federal government. It's the standard for modern affordable housing distribution.

Back to Moore square – it's a fairly impressive spread of income levels, but it's not a perfect project, advocates say that it's problematic for splitting market rate and affordable housing in to separate buildings, and not including housing on the whole property in a favor for a hotel.

These are just some recent examples, but the city has surpassed its goals in building affordable housing.

> _When I was on council, we had a new director of housing and neighborhoods come in, Larry Jarvis, and he's the one who got this started. He set a goal for us to build 5,700 affordable units by 2026. We have already, we will surpass the goal. So that's great news._

To clarify, currently as of March 2025, **[3,848 affordable units are built or preserved](https://raleighnc.gov/housing/news/city-launches-new-affordable-housing-dashboard)**, with the remaining units already in the pipeline by the goal of 2026. Detailed progress can be seen at the just launched the [Affordable Housing Dashboard](https://raleighnc.gov/housing/services/affordable-housing-goals#paragraph--376514), displaying all units at different income levels.

Another noble effort by the city were its efforts for the unhoused populations in Raleigh, such as the Bringing Neighbors Home initiative:

> _Then we have a new director of housing and neighborhoods, Emma Sutton, who has really taken things to the next level. One of my favorites is Bringing Neighbors Home, which is our new pilot program. We put $5 million into that to try to get people who are currently unhoused into stable housing. And we do that through monthly grants._
>
> _So this whole program just kicked off, but the goal is to house 45 families. And this is a proven model across the country. And people often say, “Oh, you're giving them direct grants?” Yes, because what we have found is people are responsible. People do pay their bills. 60% of our unsheltered community works. So it's like, “Hey, we want to help them.”_
>
> _When I think about the trauma people must go through when they're unhoused, living in cars or living in an encampment, or even, you know, they're couch-surfing. [...] I've talked to a number of people who live in hotels. They're paying a ton of money to live in a hotel. They could easily afford a house with that money or an apartment. But the fact is they don't have the money for the security deposit first and last month's rent._

## Mayor Mary-Ann's Legacy

Okay honestly it was really cool having the _mayor of a major city_ talk here on a video right? Especially a mayor with such _urbanist_ views, it's something we need more of in other cities. [Her record isn't perfect](https://indyweek.com/news/wake/raleigh-mayor-mary-ann-baldwin-isnt-running-for-reelection-how-will-her-legacy-hold-up/), but regardless of criticism, I asked her what she thought of her work over the past nearly two decades:

> _Quite frankly, you know, there's a local, a small group of people who are very loud and angry. Some of whom were former city council members who lost their seats. They lost their power and their friends. And those were the ones who were the most vocal._
>
> _When you're a city of almost 500,000 people and you do surveys and you see that the majority of people are happy, you know you're doing something right. So I just have always conducted myself in a way that I'm going to do what I said I was going to do._
>
> _The other thing is too, people don't like it. But also people don't like strong women. And I swear that if I was a man, people would say, "Oh, she's a great leader. Whoa, sticks her guns in, you know, bubba." But being a woman makes things different. And, you know, when I talk to other women mayors, there's actually a research study being done on this that I participated in. But we do get treated differently from our male counterparts._
>
> _And that's like what people say verbally, what the kinds of emails we get. You know, they don't often send emails to men calling them fat and ugly. And, you know, that's kind of common. So it's, I just look at it and say, "I've been true to myself the entire time I was on council." And the entire time I was mayor. I followed through on what I campaigned on and said I was going to do. It's that simple._

Barring all this, she clearly has had a **lasting impact** on addressing Raleigh's housing crisis, expansions in public transportation, success in city-wide economic redevelopment projects, and in general her long standing efforts for housing advocacy and public transportation advocacy, two things we love here on this channel!

She just left office and much of politics in general in November last year, around when I filmed this interview, so I asked her what she's doing next!

> _So interesting, what's next? Well, I've gone from two and a half jobs to one and a half jobs. So I am, you know, carrying my passion as the executive director of the Cooper Charitable Foundation. We are providing housing stability grants to help get people into housing._
>
> _I also served on the GoTriangle board, which is our regional transit authority. I'm vice chair, and it looks like from all reports that I will end up being the new incoming chair._
>
> _But again, going back to my passion, I'm sitting here now going, okay, my two jobs, housing, and transit. And so I guess that tells you everything you need to know about what matters to me. I didn't think about that until now. Those are the two things I'm doing. Okay. That is kind of funny. I didn't think about that until just now that, oh my goodness._
>
> _Yeah, the two things I've worked on for like 15 years is what I'm still working on. Housing, I'm working on it. So it is what it is. Oh, Lord. All right._

## Concluding

Man, that was a long video! Thanks for sticking around! Huge thank you to Mary-Ann for interviewing for this video and making this possible, I think this one was super interesting. Raleigh is just a small microcosm of many mid-sized American cities seeing a population boom, and I think there's much to learn from a city like Raleigh. Hopefully you took something from this video, and weren't blinded by recently buzzed head! 😆
