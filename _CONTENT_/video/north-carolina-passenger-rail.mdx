When you think trains in the United States, you think of very few places. You probably think of New England, you probably think of Chicagoland, California, or maybe even Florida.

However, the place you likely have never thought about is this powerhouse of a state: **North Carolina**! This state has been breaking Amtrak's ridership records with its bipartisan investment in rail over the past several decades.

The Amtrak Piedmont represents decades of collaborative success between Amtrak, North Carolina DOT, the North Carolina Railroad Company, and many other entities.

Spanning from Charlotte to Raleigh, the corridor spans the majority of major city centers of North Carolina, connecting the ninth largest state by population with extremely effective passenger rail service.

And I took the train up from Atlanta just to find out what's so special about it. So join me today, as we take a deep dive into what makes this service so special, and why its existence is so unique in the United States.

## My Grand Quest

Now, getting to North Carolina via train from Atlanta was quite the journey to say the least. The quest begins at 11pm, at this sad state of an Amtrak station.

### Tangent on Atlanta → Charlotte

Atlanta used to have quite an impressive array of passenger rail infrastructure in Downtown proper, Atlanta Union and Atlanta Terminal near Five Points. Atlanta was once the central hub of southern rail travel, however, decades of disinvestment in downtown and rapid freeway construction led to the bulldozing of nearly all passenger rail service here in Atlanta.

So anyway, today I get to live this reality, and now I have to go to this one sad rail station north of Midtown, once known as **Brookwood Station**, and now called **Peachtree Station.** This station became the one singular Atlanta railroad station after Union closed in 1971. These days, it only serves exactly **one** train a day in each direction, the [Amtrak Crescent](https://www.amtrak.com/crescent-train), from New Orleans to New York City.

And that's where my quest begins, at 11:36pm we depart from Peachtree Station, neck pillow and earplugs in hand. It was mad busy too! This station was absolutely packed, even for 11pm at night, honestly I had no idea the service was this popular. _Hello GDOT? Can we get more trains here?_

Now y'all, I can't sleep in planes, and this was my first overnight train, and let me tell you it was quite similarly brutal. You've got way more room sure, but its just as loud as a plane, a bit musty, and while my neighbor was nice, she had her iPhone cable laying in my lap the entire time!

But I lived, the ride was about 6 hours, and took me to Charlotte by around 5am, where I groggily freshened up in the Charlotte station bathroom. Everything was precisely on time, so nothing to complain there! Luckily, there was a Starbucks across the street, where I camped out until it got a bit warmer.

### Charlotte → Raleigh

Now onto the good stuff. I'll spare details on Charlotte for another video, but I caught the North Carolina Piedmont train next after exploring Charlotte for the day.

Once you're in Charlotte, the rail service gets impressively better. Going from the Crescent in Atlanta, at only one train a day at _11:36pm,_ the North Carolina Piedmont comes every two or so hours **all day.** _Seriously Atlanta, can we get a daytime Crescent northbound? Is that too much to ask?_

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0005.jpg)

Anyway, I caught the [Piedmont](https://www.ncbytrain.org/schedules/Pages/piedmont.aspx) at 2pm, and this train ride was only three hours. This train was whipping, and in my opinion daytime trains are way more interesting than nighttime trains. Theres so many little towns along this route, lots to see, and I even got both seats to myself on this train. It was quite busy too, lots of people just getting from place to place using the service.

I didn't sleep the night before so I was so tired, I could barely read a book. We got to Raleigh slightly late around 5:30pm, the train stopped for a brief section midway for about ten minutes or so. However this train was super neat, since it was the holidays, every stop had families reuniting outside the train, and felt almost nostalgic in a way, like how trains are always portrayed in older movies.

### Introducing Donald Arant, VP of Engineering at NCRR

I'm super excited today to have [Donald Arant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-arant-pe-1240aa67/), VP of Engineering at the [North Carolina Railroad Company](https://ncrr.com/company/our-team-leadership/), to join me on this video!

> _But Nathan full disclosure actually saw your YouTube channel and I'm subscribed and I'm enjoying the videos. I'm really intrigued! It's kind of stuff I enjoy. But let me just, if I can, I'll just say a few things._
>
> _I've been a graduate of NC State Civil Engineering, got in the rail industry actually in 2008. So I spent a good number of years in the public works side of things, actually a little bit in the private sector. Then did roadway and water and sewer design in the municipal level with City of Greensboro. But then got in the rail industry when the economy tanked, it was crazy._
>
> _I got into a track design position with Ralph Whitehead Associates, which became this STV. And then the economy tanked, gas prices went to $4 a gallon._
>
> _I was driving to different projects. I was like, what have I done? I've looked like my good public sector job with good benefits. And now, you know, all my friends are losing their jobs. It just, it was, but in the long run, it's been a tremendous story, but in my mind, because I had a chance to build a track design group and work for different railroads. In a sense, as an engineer, consulting engineer, did work for CSX, other short line railroads and then became familiar with the North Carolina Railroad. So in 2015, I joined North Carolina Railroad working for Jim Kessler._
>
> _He was a VP of Engineering at the time and [NCDOT Rail Division](http://ncbytrain.org/) was in the throes of their PIT program, the [Piedmont Improvement Program](https://www.ncdot.gov/divisions/rail/projects/Pages/piedmont-improvement-program.aspx), where they got the $540 million from the ARRA money from 2009. And just track instruction going on all over the state. I think you're familiar with the passenger programs that are, you know, that the rail division supports. So it's been a real blessing in the sense of getting into the rail industry in 2008 and then the economy recovering and just really a lot of great things happening in North Carolina._

## Historical Context of North Carolina

To understand the origins of North Carolina's passenger rail, we have to go way way back. Almost everything to do with American settlement patterns is thanks to the origins of the railroads.

As Europeans colonized North Carolina and kicked out native populations, settlers realized they could make a _lot_ of money farming tobacco on the fertile lands of the Carolinas. After the Revolutionary War, North Carolina developed an extensive economic system of slave plantations to export cotton and tobacco.

Due to factors such as the Appalachian Mountains and former Native American trade routes, most trade and economic activity formed along a single corridor, known as the Piedmont Crescent. North Carolina was famous for being late to rail infrastructure, but in 1836, the [Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad](https://digital.ncdcr.gov/digital/collection/p16062coll15/id/1382) was built and connected the port of Wilmington to the capital of Raleigh. And most importantly, in 1849, the North Carolina Railroad Company was created by [act of the legislature](https://digital.ncdcr.gov/digital/collection/p16062coll15/id/1382) to extend that railroad west to Greensboro, High Point, and Charlotte.

> #### Donald Arant
>
> _So some history is that originally in 1849 we were chartered 176 years ago, in 1849 segments of our line were built originally from Goldsboro over to Charlotte._
>
> _Goldsboro up to Raleigh, Raleigh over to Greensboro, Greensboro to Charlotte, we operated our railroad. In fact, I found a timetable from the 1860s. A passenger train would run each way each day. So one would leave from Goldsboro, one would leave from Charlotte and they would run the length of the line on a daily basis. Fascinating just that history. Well, in 1871 Richmond and Dandle railroad was looking to expand south from Virginia. So they were interested in building a line to Charlotte._
>
> _Well, I guess without going into all the details, they ended up leasing our line. So the lease was they had to lease our entire railroad instead of just the Greensboro to Charlotte segment._
>
> _That's when we got out of the operating business and Richmond and Danville became our operator and maintainer. Of course, Richmond and Danville bankrupted in 1893. A lot of railroads didn't survive 1893, big economic downturn, big recession. In 1894, Southern Railway was formed out of that, and in 1895 they struck a 99 year lease with us to that came, you know, went all the way to 1994._

### Ups and Downs

The Piedmont region [did not fare well in the coming years post Civil War, like much of the South.](https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/north-carolina) North Carolina's economy especially suffered throughout reconstruction, as the decline of agricultural opportunity, continued Great Migration of Black populations northward, and the Great Depression left North Carolina a declining region in many ways.

A truly horrifying microcosm of this was the story of the Wilmington Massacre. Wilmington, North Carolina post Civil War was a rare example of Black affluence, a majority black city that had a rather large and successful economy of black owned businesses. However, in 1897, North Carolina's Democratic Party decided to embark on a white supremacy campaign to try to drive Populist and Republican politicians out of power, leading to a literal coup de taut by thousands of supremest whites, who slaughtered at least fourteen Black people and forced all Black and Republican politicians out of power. North Carolina has a long history of unfortunate racial politics can be felt to this very day, [Vox Media did a really great documentary about this story, I highly recommend it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVQomlXMeek)

<Video src="LVQomlXMeek" />

Over the next century, the railroads fell out of popularity in favor of independent transportation via the car. In some ways this was a reaction to reconstruction efforts and a desire for whites to escape city centers and put physical distance between the poverty in cities and the affluence of shiny new car-dependent suburban sprawl post WWII. However North Carolina wasn't a very urbanized state due to its agrarian and manufacturing roots.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0007.jpg)

So with its economy struggling, North Carolina needed to reinvent itself and find new industries to exist in a urbanizing United States. So by the 1950's, the state invested heavily in research, education, the state university system and the [Research Triangle.](https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/research-triangle-park/) Ultimately, this proved to be majorly successful, bringing massive investments to the Piedmont Crescent mega-region, including universities such as Duke, UNC, NC State, and major industries such as manufacturing, aviation, research, pharmaceuticals, banking, and technology, notably around the Research Triangle.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0008.jpg)

[The Research Triangle](https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/research-triangle-park/), formed by Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, brought forth companies such as IBM and Burroughs-Wellcome. Towards the southern part of the corridor, Charlotte specifically became a major hub for banking in the United States, becoming the home for banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo. All of this has led to massive explosions in population and economic investment in the region.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0009.jpg)

### Unique Ownership Structure

North Carolina realized by the 1990's that its urbanization efforts had serious transportation challenges. There was massive transportation demands between the major population centers of the Piedmont Crescent, specifically Raleigh and Charlotte, and its car infrastructure was choked full of traffic.

While North Carolina had some form of long distance passenger rail service until the 1970s through Southern Railway, this shuttered after Southern dramatically reduced service in 1976 and eventually handed over the remaining operation to newly formed Amtrak in 1979.

After a failed attempt by Amtrak to reintroduce passenger service in 1984, Amtrak officially introduced the Carolinian, a long distance route from Charlotte to New York City. This route was immediately popular, and North Carolina's state officials had a bipartisan push to increase service.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0010.jpg)

And luckily, North Carolina had a trick up it's sleeve, that nearly no other state in the country had - remember how North Carolina actually had majority ownership of its main railroad through the North Carolina Railroad Company? [Well, North Carolina bought out the remaining private shareholders of the NCRR in the 1990's, making 100% of shares owned by the state of North Carolina.](https://ncrr.com/company/)

> #### Donald Arant
>
> _In the 1990s, the state said, "hey, we want to manage passenger services, we want to own the North Carolina Railroad." So they bought out all the private shareholders and it took about five years. So in 1999, we struck a current master agreement with Norfolk Southern for them to keep operating and maintaining our railroad._
>
> _Now we operate under a master agreement with Norfolk Southern. We're separate from NC DOT Rail, we're a separate entity we're, you know, a railroad. Our 317 mile long corridor is the corridor we ow, and Norfolk Southern operates and maintains that under a master agreement. So the rail division is actually formed in the 1990s when the Carolinian and Piedmont services picked up._

Why is this important? Typically, the railroads are owned by freight rail companies, and the freight companies have full control of leases to other service, such as Amtrak passenger service. This makes it quite difficult to do _anything_ other than freight on rail tracks, as freight companies like Norfolk South and CSX are for profit companies, and there is not much incentive to run anything but freight.

However on the mainline spine of North Carolina's corridor, NCRR actually leases the tracks to freight companies like Norfolk Southern for freight operations, instead of vice versa. NCRR also pays Norfolk Southern to maintain the railway while keeping ownership. This allows for a lot more control by the state to operate rail service on the tracks, as NCRR acts like a bargaining table between the government bodies, the freight companies, and Amtrak.

> #### Donald Arant
>
> _It's interesting in the sense that North Carolina Railroad Company, we are a private company and we own our 317 miles. But we are owned, our stock is owned by the state of North Carolina. So our board of directors is established that way. And that way our priorities and our vision and our mission are determined by our leadership and our board of directors._
>
> _We partner with the rail division with Norfolk Southern as our operating and maintaining railroads. So you're right. It is a unique relationship. It's something that I think only Alaska was the other railroad that's owned by the state, say by the state of Alaska. So that Alaska and North Carolina are the only two states that say owned a railroad._
>
> _It's fascinating to me because so as VP of engineering for North Carolina Railroad, I'm responsible for protecting this 317 mile long corridor. But protection in that mind, in my mindset is that we have to work with Norfolk Southern who operates and maintains our railroad for us. And then also you've got the NC DOT rail division, and Amtrak as stakeholders involved. We have to make sure that we are mindful, respectful of their needs as well._
>
> _So it's a challenge. It's a challenge._

### Amtrak Piedmont

Anyway, back to the state's push to expand service on the Amtrak Carolinian. Even though Amtrak wasn't interested to expansion as they were short on vehicles, North Carolina committed to the project by purchasing five passenger cars and leasing two locomotives to create the Amtrak Piedmont service, a local service between Charlotte and Raleigh.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0001.jpg)

It proved to be an extremely quick success! The corridor from Charlotte to Raleigh is 173 miles long, making it fall perfectly between the optimal distances for long distance rail of over 100 miles and below 500 miles.

The travel time on the train is comparable to driving, sometimes out beating it due to traffic. The train takes three hours end to end traveling the full length, while driving takes 2 hours and forty minutes with no traffic.

The train is especially appealing at this distance versus flying, as flying requires more time once you factor in transportation to and from the airport, the recommended 90 minute buffer before your flight for security, and the general uncomfortable nature of flying. The train is spacious, roomy, and one could even say luxurious versus the plane.

> #### Donald Arant
>
> _I could get on the train in Charlotte in the morning, 6:30am leaving Charlotte and get to Raleigh by 10:17. Most times it was on time or it was in within a few minutes of being on time. It's on time performance was so pretty reliable. And then have meetings, the rail division folks would come pick me up._
>
> _I mean, they were intrigued that a consultant would actually use the train, use the service, you know, that they were promoting._

## Huge economic returns

While NCDOT struggled a bit in the following decades to increase service, due to needed track upgrades, station enhancements, and more, the service post COVID has now increased to _five round trips a day_ between the Carolinian and the Piedmont. [Since COVID, the rail lines have broke numerous ridership records for Amtrak, quickly becoming one of the most successful services in Amtrak history](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article298182838.html), thanks to bipartisan coalitions and cross industry partnerships. [From 2023 to 2024, the Amtrak Piedmont actually increased 24.4%!](https://media.amtrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FY24-Year-End-Ridership-Fact-Sheet.pdf)

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0016.jpg)

Since the state of North Carolina is only a shareholder of NCRR, and does not directly own the railroad, this has unlocked other unique opportunities due to the companies status as a private company.

> #### Donald Arant
>
> _Honestly, that's, I don't know all the details about the different exact difference. But the basic premise is, is that we want to invest in companies, provide grant opportunities for companies that will build rail infrastructure and support the rail industry as well as bring jobs to North Carolina. We feel like it's a win-win for, for the state as well as for the rail industry._
>
> _So, and the beauty of it is, is that those rail service sites don't have to be on the North Carolina Railroad. We feel like that if we can provide some incentive for companies, for rail service companies, especially to come to North Carolina and connect anywhere on the railroad network, that that'll help all of North Carolina, not just North Carolina Railroad or those counties and cities served by North Carolina Railroad._
>
> _So that's really the premise behind it all is that we feel like that by investing back in North Carolina and investing in companies that will invest in North Carolina, then we help the state and we help grow our economy._

This also allowed the NCRR to receive [$105 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation](https://governor.nc.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/24/north-carolina-railroad-company-secures-1056-million-transformational-rail-improvements), that will fund capacity enhancements across the Charlotte-to-Raleigh corridor, which will enable enhanced speeds by rounding sharp turns, and increasing capacity across the region.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0017.jpg)

> #### Donald Arant
>
> _We want to the first the biggest one is we want to extend the siding between Morrisville and Kerry. It's actually like between Durham and Raleigh kind of thing, but from Morrisville to Kerry. With the PIPP program._
>
> _There was roadbed built for two tracks in this area. There were two bridges built with PIPP. We did the Morrisville Parkway Grade Separation Project and then North Carolina railroad completely on our own or I say that with the town of Morrisville. We actually replaced the Crabtree Creek Rail Bridge and made that a double track bridge._
>
> _So building on that investment, building on past investment with the Piedmont improvement program, we actually put together a project to extend the current Clegg Denelson siding the two control points. Clegg Denelson, we would extend that siding another four to five miles toward Kerry and that would make a longer siding so that the two passenger trains, 76 and 79 could actually meet on the fly as opposed to one waiting on the other with the current schedule._
>
> _The way it's set up. So that's the probably one of the biggest elements of CAPFE. Another one, another project, there's two projects, two short sidings, one in Hillsborough and one by Elon University. These are about half a mile along each and as a freight guy that kind of, you know, had a little heartburn over that start with, but it would be a half a mile long siding in these two locations to allow two passenger trains to get out of the way or to tuck in off the main._
>
> _If another one's coming and that would it would help facilitate meets along the line. Another thing too is PO 7 is the local that comes out of Durham, NC over to Elon, NC and that Elon siding is actually a place where PO 7 could get off the main and get out of the way so the passenger trains could operate on an embedded._
>
> _So that so those two sidings are part of the CAPFE program. We're actually doing a curve improvement in Hillsborough to improve track speed from currently 40 miles an hour through this one stretch in Hillsborough to 65 miles an hour. So that that will be a huge improvement in that area._
>
> _Norfolk Southern is going to replace all the rail between Greensboro and Raleigh. It's about 69 track miles total. It's 81 miles from Greensboro to Raleigh, but about 69 of that replace all that rail and it'll it'll bring all that that relay rail up to a new rail standard. And then NC DOT is contributing the Cornwallis Road Great separation. So that's a fully funded project that'll eliminate a great crossing and provide some track improvements as well._
>
> _So well, and then we're studying some bridges and doing some clearance project studies, but but that's that's really the CAPFE program. It's really exciting. Different different category. That's actually NC DOT rail division is doing that and that's all. Yeah, that's on the CSXS line._

In addition, [phase one of the S-Line high speed rail project is moving forward](https://www.ncdot.gov/divisions/rail/s-line-projects/raleigh-richmond/Pages/default.aspx), connecting Raleigh to Wake Forest through $1.1 billion in funding from the **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.** This initial 17-mile segment is part of a larger vision to reconnect Raleigh and Richmond with faster, more efficient rail service.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0018.jpg)

Virginia has already purchased its segment of the corridor from CSX, with North Carolina in progress of purchasing the rest of the railway corridor. Once completed, the S-Line will shave 90 minutes off travel times between the two cities, making train trips to Washington, D.C. extremely competitive with driving.

> #### Donald Arant
>
> _Well, that does involve the North Carolina Railroad on a small level. It actually ties into our corridor there in Raleigh at the at the control point at Boiling, NC. We're involved with some of that as far as reviewing plans and reviewing what what DOT rail division wants to do on that CSX corridor._
>
> _But yeah, that's what a little over a billion dollars of Fed State Partnership grant that it's exciting because it's going to provide a lot of good rail infrastructure from Raleigh North toward that off the NCR corridor._
>
> _It is fascinating to see because I believe it's going to provide infrastructure from Raleigh. Actually Raleigh Union Station, it'll provide another platform at Raleigh Union Station._
>
> _So they can turn service and go north and then provide what aerial structures across Capitol Boulevard and up to the northern part of Raleigh and really be a nice, nice improvement._

Looking ahead, talks are also underway to establish a high-speed rail corridor between Atlanta and Charlotte. This project, part of the Corridor ID Program, would provide a crucial link between the Southeast’s major economic hubs, further solidifying North Carolina’s role as a leader in rail development. Additionally, other exciting developments include the Carolinian getting new rail cars via Amtrak by 2026 and Charlotte's brand new intercity rail station.

![](/assets/video/north-carolina-passenger-rail/0020.jpg)

While I'm doubtful I'll see this in my lifetime, I can tell you that more service Atlanta northward would be especially awesome! We haven't seen daylight service south of Charlotte in the entire history of Amtrak.

## Concluding Thoughts

What does all of this prove? That it's _never too late to invest in good public transportation._ If you build it, they will come, all it requires is political will. Public services provide a real public good, and often can provide outward economic impacts far and wide that are worth investing in, even if they don't provide immediate profit's on the surface.

So while this has all been able to happen in North Carolina because of it's unique ownership of the railroad, it should serve as a shining example to other metro areas that there are major benefits to rail service expansions, and I think there can be larger bipartisan pushes for rail across the board with the right messaging.
