## Collaborations

Looking to work with me on a story? I run a video journalism YouTube channel under my own name **Nathan Davenport**, where I deep dive into topics I find interesting, through a documentary and video essay format. Currently, I focus on many topics relating to **urban planning** and **cities in general**, including transportation, real estate, housing, and general urbanism overall.

### Interviews and Story Collaborations

I often collaborate with other people or organizations. This looks like a standard interview, where I do a recorded interview in person or over video call to gather information on a subject. I will use this footage in my video to support the subject.

This can also be a more in depth collaboration, where the person or organization reviews the video and helps with the writing process. Since these projects take a ton of work, I do consider charging for collaborative stories.

If you would like to be interviewed or collaborate with me on a story, please reach out!

### Sponsorships

I am also available to take sponsorships on my channel. I have more than **6,000 subscribers** on Youtube and **350,000 views** on the platform, and am always available for ad breaks of various types. Please reach out to me if you are an advertiser and we can discuss further.

## Services

### Photography Session

I have ten years of photography experience shooting live events, concerts, portraits, studio sessions, creative projects, family photos, and more. I am always available to do a shoot on film, digital, or both.

My rates are flexible, depending on requirements for film development, editing, travel, or complexity. I am always looking for something challenging, reach out to me if you have a project in mind!

### Freelance Work

I am always open to new video editing, graphic design, or software development projects. I work professionally as a software engineer, and have tons of experience in both front end and back end work. I also am open to video editing and graphic design work, due to thousands of hours of work for my YouTube channel. Reach out to me if you have a project in mind!
