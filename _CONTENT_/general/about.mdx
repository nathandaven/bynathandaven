I'm Nathan Davenport, a professional **software engineer**, self proclaimed **video-journalist**, and **photographer** in **Atlanta, Georgia**.

My first passion is programming. Ever since I was really little, I was building computers, jailbreaking iPod Touches, and sort of learning programming languages from primitive 2006 YouTube videos. I ended up going to college at the **Georgia Institute of Technology** for **Computational Media**, and I now work professionally as a **Software Engineer**, with over **three years** of experience in **Typescript**, **React**, and **Kubernetes**.

However, I have other passions as well. I grew up in the suburbs of **Atlanta, Georgia**, Cobb County specifically, but have always been obsessed with cities. I put thousands of hours into **Sim City 4** as a kid, and probably about the same amount into **Cities Skylines** as an adult!

I just find **urban studies** really interesting, which is why I made a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@nathandaven) where I deep dive into **local urbanism**, including **land use**, **transportation**, **real-estate**, and more.

Some of my other hobbies include **taking photos** and **producing music**. You can see some of my public work on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nathandaven), or look through my public albums [here](photography) on this website. For the meantime, thanks for reading. ðŸ«¶
