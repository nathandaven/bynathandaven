Remaking my personal portfolio site.

## Technologies used

- Next.JS
- React
- MDX
- Vercel deployment

## Content Directory

This directory holds all of the content for the site. All routes here are mapped to the webpage routes generated.

This is managed using Front Matter CMS in VS Code. I'm really liking this concept of a local CMS controlled by git, and it's really convenient to write in Markdown.

I'm already itching to redesign this again. We shall see lol!

## Getting Started

First

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
